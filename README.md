# softarm stimulator and controller
# stimulate the posture of the 9 segs soft arm robot
# using least_square function in scipy.optimizer to do inverse kinematics .In order to reduce the complexity of model 
and increse the avaible range of the robot segment, three segments would be combined as one bigger segment to change 
the model of 9 segs robot into 3 segs robot
